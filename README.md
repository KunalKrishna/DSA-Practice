# DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. I use Java, Python, and C++ to solve problems from various platforms and books.

## Directory Structure
- `Java/`: Solutions in Java
- `Python/`: Solutions in Python
- `Cpp/`: Solutions in C++

## Problem Sources
- `LeetCode/`: Problems from LeetCode organized by topic (Array, Trees, etc.)
- `Books/`: Exercises from books such as "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and "Cracking the Coding Interview".
- `CustomProblems/`: My custom problems or implementations.

## Resources
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
